Rapidly developed 2D mobile game prototype.


A simple mobile game developed within 10 days. The main focus was to gain game design experience, practice user
interface and user experience concepts, as well as build a game project from start to finish.

The main objective is to craft objects by pressing on the parts that belong to the item listed on the recipe before the
time runs out. For the crafted items the user is rewarded with cash that can be spent on customising the looks of the
game.
