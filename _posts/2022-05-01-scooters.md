## Summary

I had the pleasure of being the team leader and one of the main Java programmers in one of the Software Engineering Assignments. The project involved creating a fully-functional web application with database support encapsulated in a user-friendly interface.

The source code is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Pawel_Wilczewski/comp2913_scooters). Check out the designated wiki page with more information about the project.
