## Summary

My `Unity` game submission to the [XR Games Futures Programming Test](https://github.com/XRGames/xr-challenge). Time spent ~15 days.
The game features:
- 100% custom movement component made from scratch
- event-based architecture
- something
- something else
- and that on top of everything

Access and play the game on the dedicated [itch.io page](https://pawelwilczewski.itch.io/xr-challenge-puzzle-game).
I recommed playing the game before watching the walkthrough video:
