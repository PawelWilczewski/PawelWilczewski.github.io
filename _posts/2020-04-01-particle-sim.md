## Summary

`Unity` 10-day mobile game prototype revolving around simulating particles. The user can control the placement and parameters of _level influencers_. These objects alter the state of matter of fluids and solids, and thus allow to control the location and behaviour of particles. The goal is to end up with a defined amount of particles in preset areas of the level.
