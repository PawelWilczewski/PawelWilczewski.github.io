Sandbox game with physics simulation of solid, liquid and gas particles in one level.


10-day mobile game prototype revolving around physics particle simulation. The user can control the placement and
parameters of _level influencers_. These objects alter the state of matter of fluids and solids, and thus allow to
control the location and behaviour of particles. The goal is to end up with a defined amount of particles in preset
areas of the level.
