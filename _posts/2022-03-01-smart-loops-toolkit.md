## Summary

Whenever modelling in Blender, I always seemed to miss a few essential tools, which could have speeded up my workflow by a big margin. I decided to code them myself and pack them into an add-on. The documentation and all required information is available on [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/smart-loops-toolkit) and [Gumroad](https://pawelwilczewski.gumroad.com/l/smart-loops-toolkit).
