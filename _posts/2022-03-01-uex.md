## Summary

Blender pipeline-improving add-on allowing for effortless exporting to Unreal Engine 4/5. At first, I created this addon to satisfy my own needs. Since it helped in my workflow so much, I decided to publish and list it for a very affordable price. The addon is available on [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/uex-blender-to-unreal) and [Gumroad](https://pawelwilczewski.gumroad.com/l/uex-blender-to-unreal).
