Add-on for exporting assets to Unreal Engine with minimal setup, ensuring correct results in the engine.


Blender pipeline-improving add-on allowing for effortless exporting to Unreal Engine 4/5. At first, I created this addon
to improve my own workflow, and I decided to publish it and allow others to take advantage of faster iteration times.
The addon is available on [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/products/uex-blender-to-unreal) and
[Gumroad](https://pawelwilczewski.gumroad.com/l/uex-blender-to-unreal).
