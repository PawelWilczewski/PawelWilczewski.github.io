<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

Capable 3D rendering framework with abstracted object transform and component systems.


My final graphics project assignment for the graphics module at the university. Time spent ~10 days.

The features include:
- Abstracted scene and entity system.
- Efficient and fully-dynamic batch rendering system.
- Material system.
- Easy-to-use mesh and texture libraries.
- Phong and Blinn-Phong shading models - switched in real-time.
- Implementing new shading models is straight-forward.
- Easily extendable to other graphics APIs.
- Math utilities written from scratch (assignment requirement).
- `ImGui` user interface integration.
