## Summary

`Unreal Engine` Template Project to be released on Unreal Marketplace. Aiming for high-quality assets and immersive,
realistic gameplay combined with fluid movement for the best user experience. The logic is split between `C++` and
`Blueprints` for good performance and ease of control. Networking support is incoming, as well as a plenty other
features I set as a requirement for the first release.

The project is currently developed in `Unreal Engine 5` - upon porting from `UE4`.
