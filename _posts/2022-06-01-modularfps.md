## Summary

`Unreal Engine` Template Project to be released on Unreal Marketplace. Aiming for high-quality assets and immersive, realistic gameplay combined with fluid movement for the best user experience. The logic is split between `C++` and `Blueprints` for good performance and ease of control. Networking support is incoming, as well as a plenty other features I set as a requirement for the first release.

The project is currently developed in `Unreal Engine 4`, however, I am planning on porting it to `UE5` very soon. The planned release date is Q3 2023.
